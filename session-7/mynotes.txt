Here you will take your notes
client-server model
Client send a request to the server and the server response to the request of the client, like this with every client trying
to connect to the server. If there is no request, nothing happens but if there is no server, there is nothing attending to
the request so no response is produced. Client can be any device such as computers or phones. There can be more than one server running
at the same time as well as a client can connect to more than one server.

You can have a client connected to the server being both in that computer. Client and server are connected through a network (internet).
Inside the internet there are isolated computers connected to each other, divided in groups called networks and if we want to send a message
from C to S we need an IP adress, all computer connected to internet have a network interface and some of them more than one, each one correspond
to a different IP so a Computer can have more than one IP adress cause they depend on the computer to which you are connected.

IP adress of my phone:10.0.43.120 (connected to wireless urjc)
IP adress of my home:
IP of my computer today: 212.128.253.90
IP of the teacher: 212.128.253.64

Ping is a command that says if the computer is alive.

ping time to 8.8.8.8:
time=3.53 ms

ping time to my computer's IP:
time=0.054 ms

ping time to a computer in my network:
time=0.600 ms

ping time to the network of my phone:
time = 1690 ms

URL = used to identify a computer interface for humans.

ping time to google:216.58.211.228
time=3.72 ms

ping time to www.urjc.es:
time=2.07 ms

We need the IP adress to communicate to any server but if there are more than one application in a server. We can identify each app with the port
number. Usually the main app has the number port 80, but the other ones has other numbers (e.x. 8080) THIS IS A TEXT EXAMPLE FOR ADDING TO MY FILE
